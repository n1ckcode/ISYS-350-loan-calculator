# ISYS-350-loan-calculator

Using a while loop to create a list of monthly payments. Create a Python program that asks user to enter the following information: term (number of years), yearly interest rate, starting loan amount, ending loan amount and loan step value; then use the following payment formula:

𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=𝐿∗𝑅121−(1+𝑅12)−12∗𝑇

Where L is the total amount of the loan. R is the annual interest rate, T the length of the term (in years) to compute and display the payment for each amount of the loan.
